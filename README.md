## About the Project

**vr.COMA (Versatile & Reactive Chromatic Orchestration & Mood Analyzer)** is a single-page web application that leverages a Large Language Model to generate complete color palettes from natural language prompts. The application's interface is fully reactive, instantly adopting the generated theme for an immersive, real-time preview. Designed for developers and designers, users can save, manage, and revise themes, making it a versatile tool for any project requiring a cohesive visual identity.

1.  **Input a Description:** The user starts by typing a descriptive prompt into a text box. This could be anything from "a serene forest in the early morning" to "a vibrant and energetic cityscape at night."<br/>
2.  **Generate a Theme:** Upon submitting the prompt, the application sends the request to an LLM, which generates a palette of complementary colors. These colors are then displayed on the screen. As a key feature, various UI elements of the web application itself will dynamically change to reflect the newly generated theme, offering an immediate preview.<br/>
3.  **Receive Advice:** Along with the color palette, the LLM will provide advice and a rationale for why these colors work well together and how they might be used effectively in different contexts.<br/>
4.  **Revise and Refine:** If the user is not fully satisfied, they can revise their input - for example, by adding "with a touch of lavender" - to regenerate and adjust the theme.<br/>
5.  **Save and Manage:** Users can save their favorite generated themes to their personal collection. They can then view, update the names or descriptions of, or delete these saved themes at any time.<br/><br/>
